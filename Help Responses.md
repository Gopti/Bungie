### Conqueror Seal Not Counting ::
This is a known issue and Bungie is investigating. The two new Throne World Grandmasters are not counting toward the triumph. Additionally, you can view the Year 5 Known issues being investigated [url=https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/4416375175444-Destiny-2-Year-5-Known-Issues-and-Vital-Information]here[/url].

### Plum Error Code ::
Error code PLUM is normally paired with a BattlEye specific error code. Do you have that error code?

### Lost Expansions ::
You can follow the directions here to try restoring your licenses on your own: https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360049196071-Accessing-and-Restoring-Licenses-to-Destiny-Content

If those don't work, you will need to work with Xbox/Steam/PSN support to determine why you no longer have access to your licenses and how to resolve the issues, as they control your licenses and not Bungie.

### Name Changes ::
Hey there. Unfortunately, only one name change is allotted at this time:
